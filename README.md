# eScience Tools in Climate Science: Linking Observations with Modeling

This repository contains the project work and final report for the **eScience Tools in Climate Science** winter course (2020), focusing on the bridge between atmospheric observations and numerical modeling.

## Project Goal
The core objective is to utilize modern eScience tools (Python, Xarray, Jupyter) to facilitate the comparison and integration of observational datasets with climate model outputs.

## Highlights
- **Final Report**: The integrated analysis is documented in `escience2020-group8-Presvelou.ipynb`, showcasing data ingestion, processing, and visualization workflows.
- **Scientific Interaction**: The project explores methodologies discussed by course organizers Michael Schulz (MetNo/UiO) and Paul Zieger (Stockholm University) regarding the synthesis of remote sensing/in-situ data with global climate models.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python-based Analysis**: Leverages the Pangeo-style stack for high-performance scientific computing.
- **Observational Synthesis**: Methods for cleaning and preparing observational data for model verification.

## Usage
The primary analysis and results can be found in the `Final-Report` subdirectory.
